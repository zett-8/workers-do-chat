pnpm run db:migrate
```

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

npm run build
npm run start
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
